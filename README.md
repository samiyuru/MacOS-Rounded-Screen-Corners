# MacOS Rounded Screen Corners

This app makes the corners of the MacOS screen round instead of the default boxy look. 
Rounded corners are more consistent with the shape of the windows of the new MacOS design. 
Also, MacOS reveals the desktop background through gaps between the window corners and the screen corners on all four sides even if the window is fully maximized and the menu bar and the dock is hidden. 
This can be distracting to some people
(This issue happens in window zoom mode where you get by clicking the green window button while pressing Option key. Not in fullscreen window mode where you get a dedicated mission control space for a single window).
See the screenshot below. Rounded corners fixes this issue as well.

## Default Boxy Screen Corners

See the corners of the screen. The red color desktop is visible through the gaps between the corners of the screen and the corners of the maximized window since the screen is boxy and the window is rounded.
